## Tasks

[ ] skew a "co-annotation google doc" 
  [ ] [see if possible] This can be actually modifying / hacking google doc (maybe harder) maybe using a chrome extension, seeing how much it can be changed visually, can we make it look like the 3 stacked windows?
  [ ] Not actually changing a google doc but just having a website with text in the form of the 3 stacked windows (see if it's readable/usable or can just be an image artifact)
[ ] Retrieving annotation information from google docs api
  "Thinking of something that gathers change of font or highlights and brings it forward somehow, animating the emphasis strategies we used"
  Basically Proof of concept to answer the q of whether someone can be annotating in a google doc and we get that info live or not live (have the information in a file and we can represent that somehow) 
  e.g { timestamp: "10:00pm", user: "anonymous panda" action: "{made bigger|made bolder | italicized|color added| comment added | +1}", text: "Nothing has to look or function the way it does."}
